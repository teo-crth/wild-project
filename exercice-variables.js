🏁 Please take this quick challenge and rename carefully all the variable, and fix this broken code by assigning the correct 
variable keyword you have learned in the quest.
ex: const name = "David";

*/

const name = "David"; // ✅ Good!  
const lastName = "Bruno"; // ❌ the keyword to declare the variable is missing 

let davidPresentation = "Hi, I'm David Bruno from SF, I like to cook and meet new people."; // ❌ the variable name is not explicit. (this is David's biography)

const davidPicture = "http://www.go.com/davif.png"; // ❌ the variable name is not explicit and the keyword is missing (this is David's profile picture)

const cityName = "San Francisco"; // ❌ the variable name is not explicit and the keyword is missing (try to guess what "San Francisco" could refer to)

let followers = 109; // ❌ the keyword to declare the variable is missing 
let following = 200; // ❌ the keyword to declare the variable is missing 

// 🏁 Exercise 02 - David is following one more account increment the total of following account
following = following++;
